>The ERA5 re-analysis data, does not actually look identical to the operational analysis data that ECMWF publishes in realtime, and that can given as inputs. This is because (1) the NWPs used to do the assimilation are different, (2) the resolution at which the assimilation is done is also different, (3) the assimilation windows are also different, (4) I think sometimes it is also not exactly the same set of observations that contribute to the assimilation. So for a model to work best operationally, it needs to have been trained a bit on operational data.
