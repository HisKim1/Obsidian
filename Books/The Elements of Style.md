# 1. Elementary Rules of Usage
##### 1. Form the possessive singular of nouns by adding 's.
*-es, -is*로 끝나는 경우가 아니라면 (       )'s  (  )라고 써라

##### 2. In a serise of three or more terms with a single conjunction, use a comma after each term except the last.
**e.g.** red, white, and blue / gold, silver, or copper

##### 3. Enclose parenthetic expressions between commas.
parenthetic expression인지, 아닌지 판단을 잘 해야 한다.
nonrestrictive clause이면 문장을 두 개로 쪼갤 수 있고 parenthetic하다. 아니라면 못 쪼갠다.

##### 4. Place a comma before a conjunction introducing an independent clause.
> When the subject is the same for both clauses and is expressed only once, a comma is useful if the connectrive is *but*. When th econnective is *and*, the comma should be omitted if the relation between the two statements is close or immediate.

**e.g.**
>    I have heard the argument**, but** am still unconvinced.
>    He has had several years' experience **and** is thoroughly competent.

##### 5. Do not join independent clauses with a comma.
