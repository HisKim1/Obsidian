# 1. Elementary Rules of Usage
##### 1. Form the possessive singular of nouns by adding 's.
*-es, -is*로 끝나는 경우가 아니라면 (       )'s  (  )라고 써라

##### 2. In a serise of three or more terms with a single conjunction, use a comma after each term except the last.
**e.g.** red, white, and blue / gold, silver, or copper

##### 3. Enclose parenthetic expressions between commas.
parenthetic expression인지, 아닌지 판단을 잘 해야 한다.
nonrestrictive clause이면 문장을 두 개로 쪼갤 수 있고 parenthetic하다. 아니라면 못 쪼갠다.

##### 4. Place a comma before a conjunction introducing an independent clause.
> When the subject is the same for both clauses and is expressed only once, a comma is useful if the connectrive is *but*. When th econnective is *and*, the comma should be omitted if the relation between the two statements is close or immediate.

**e.g.**
>    I have heard the argument**, but** am still unconvinced.
>    He has had several years' experience **and** is thoroughly competent.

##### 5. Do not join independent clauses with a comma.
cluases를 하나로 이으려면
1) semicolon 이용
   "It is nearly half past five; we cannot reach town before dark."
2) replace the semicolons with periods
   "It is nearly half past five. We cannot reach town before dark."
3) comma 이용
   "It is nearly half past five, and we cannot reach town before dark."

세 방식을 비교해보면 ;이 더 close relationship을 보여주고, briefer and therefore more forcible. 단, clauses가 너무 짧거나 tone of sentence is easy and conversational일 때는 별로다

##### 6. Do not break sentences in two.
comma 자리에 period 두지 마라. 

##### 7. Use a colon after an independent clause to introduce a list of particulars, an appositive, an amplification, or an illustrative quotation.
1) list of particulars
   완전한 문장 뒤에 colon 붙이고 리스트 업
   "Your dedicated whittler requires three props: a knife, a piece of wood, and a back porch."
2) 2nd clause가 1st를 interpret or amplifies할 때
   "But even so, there was a directness and dispatch about animal burial: there was no stopover in the undertaker's foul parlor, no wreath or spray."
3) preceding clause를 support하거나 contribute하는 quotation 앞에
   "The squalor of the streets reminded her of a line from Oscar Wilde: "We are all in the gutter, but some of us are looking at the stars."

##### 8. Use a dash to set off an abrupt break or interruption and to announce a long appositive or summary.
dash는 comma보다 강력한 separation, colon보다 informal, parentheses보다 relaxed

##### 9. The number of the subject determines the number of the verb.
단복수 잘 맞춰라.
**common blunder**
1) *one of ...* + singular verb
2) *each, either, everyone, everybody, neither, nobody, someone* + singular verb
3) *none* (no one or not one) + singular verb
4) *none* (more than one) + plural verb
5) ~~ and ~~ + plural verb
6) 셀 수 없는 명사들 & each, every + singular verb
7) singular subject + *with, as well as, in addition to, except, together with, no less than*  + singular verb
8) 기타 등등... learn the idioms 해라...

##### 10. Use the proper case of pronoun.
