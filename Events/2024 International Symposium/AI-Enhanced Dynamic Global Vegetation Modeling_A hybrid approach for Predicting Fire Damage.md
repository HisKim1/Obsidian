# Physics-based models
- computationally intensive
- uncertainties in parameterization of subgrid-scale processes

# Data-driven models
- Identify patterns & trends
- quickly adapt to include new data sources and Types
- tied to data availability and quality
- lack of physical insights

# Integrating Phy. models w/ ML
1. Improving parameterizations
2. replacing a phycial sub-model
3. Analysis of modle-observation mismatch
4. constrain sub-models
5. surrgogate modelling or emulation

# Fire Impact on Earth sys. & modeling challenge
1. input
	1. climate
	2. PFT inform.
	3. stand struc.
	4. fuel
2. model -> 14 regions을 ML으로 replace
	1. weather danger / land property / anthropogenic effect를 각각 LSTM, NN으로 처리
