# Question
How the changes in the precip. specturm affects land? (daily, atm. $\rightarrow$ ???)
hyp: dist. the same amt of P in diff ways over a given time leads to diff mean, E, R, and SM

# 30% of global land: richer-get-drier response
precip $\uparrow$ $\Rightarrow$ soil moisture $\downarrow$ in over moist & semi-moist regions

# Soil moisture regimes in piControl simulations

# Conclusion
1. rain unevenness over land is increasing
2. over moist regions -> richer P gets drier SM responses
3. more runoff per events
4. co$\exists$ of increasing droughts and flooding for a given location
