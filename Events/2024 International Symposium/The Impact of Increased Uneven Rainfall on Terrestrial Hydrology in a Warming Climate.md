# Question
How the changes in the precip. specturm affects land? (daily, atm. $\rightarrow$ )
hyp: dist. the same amt of P in diff ways over a given time leads to diff mean, E, R, and SM

# 30% of global land: richer-get-drier response
precip $\uparrow$ $\Rightarrow$ soil moisture $\downarrow$ in over moist & semi-moist regions

# Soil moisture regimes in piControl simulations
