> The <font color="#00e676">middle troposphere</font> at 500 hPa, which is usually called the <font color="#00e676">level of nondivergence</font>, is l<font color="#00e676">ess influenced by terrain</font> and is the <font color="#00e676">most applicable height</font> for forecasting weather system movement; therefore, 500 hPa geopotential height is the <font color="#00e676">traditional meteorological element field</font> for international verification and diagnosis.^[S. Sun, et al., 2023]

> Few studies have applied BMA and EMOS to the geopotential height for probabilistic forecasting. The geopotential height field reflects the <font color="#00e676">state of the atmosphere circulation</font> and has an important <font color="#00e676">influence on the regional and hemispheric climate</font>. It is also important in short- and medium-range weather forecasts [[48](https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4433/12/2/253#B48-atmosphere-12-00253),[49](https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4433/12/2/253#B49-atmosphere-12-00253),[50](https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4433/12/2/253#B50-atmosphere-12-00253),[51](https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4433/12/2/253#B51-atmosphere-12-00253),[52](https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4433/12/2/253#B52-atmosphere-12-00253),[53](https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4433/12/2/253#B53-atmosphere-12-00253)]. An improvement in forecasting of the 500 hPa geopotential height field will help forecasters to better understand<font color="#00e676"> large-scale atmospheric circulation patterns</font> and give more accurate predictions of the weather. ^[L.

- It represents the<font color="#00e676"> middle of the troposphere</font>, where many weather systems develop.
- At this level, the effects of <font color="#00e676">surface friction are minimal</font>, making atmospheric <font color="#00e676">flow patterns clearer</font>.
- It's a good <font color="#00e676">indicator</font> of large-scale atmospheric waves and circulation patterns.
- Changes in the 500 hPa pattern often <font color="#00e676">correlate well with surface weather</font> developments.
