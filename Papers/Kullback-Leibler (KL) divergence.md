KL divergence is an asymmetric measure of the difference between two probability distributions. In information theory, it is also known as relative entropy.

# Mathematical Expression
For continuous probability distributions P and Q:

$$
D_{KL}(P||Q) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} p(x) \log \left(\frac{p(x)}{q(x)}\right) dx
$$

For discrete probability distributions:

$$
D_{KL}(P||Q) = \sum_{i} P(i) \log \left(\frac{P(i)}{Q(i)}\right)
$$

where $P(i)$ and $Q(i)$ are the probabilities of event $i$ in distributions $P$ and $Q$ respectively.

## Key Properties
1. **Asymmetry**
   : $D_{KL}(P||Q) \neq D_{KL}(Q||P)$
   
2. **Non-negativity**
   : $D_{KL}(P||Q) \geq 0$, equals 0 only when the two distributions are identical
   
3. **Triangle inequality does not hold**
   : KL divergence does not satisfy the definition of a metric
   
4. **Scale invariance**
   : Invariant to the underlying measure

## Implications and Significance in [[@R. Parthipan, et. al., 2024]]
1. **Model Performance Evaluation**
   : Measures how much the generative model's predictions deviate from the reference model
   
2. **Error Accumulation Detection**
   : An increase in $\delta(t)$ over time indicates error accumulation
   
3. **Asymmetric Penalty**
   : Penalizes more heavily when $p_{\text{gen}}$ assigns high probability to regions where $p_{cts}$ assigns low probability
   
4. **System Characteristics Reflection**
   : As $p_{\text{cts}}$ incorporates system characteristics like chaos or unobserved variables, it allows for measuring purely model deficiencies

This approach helps distinguish between correctable errors (due to model deficiencies) and uncorrectable errors (due to intrinsic system characteristics).
