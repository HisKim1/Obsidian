We investigate error growth from small-amplitude initial condition perturbations, simulated with a recent artificial intelligence-based weather prediction model. From past simulations with standard physically-based numerical models as well as from theoretical considerations it is expected that such small-amplitude initial condition perturbations would grow very fast initially. This fast growth then sets a fixed and fundamental limit to the predictability of weather, a phenomenon known as the butterfly effect. We find however, that <span style="background:rgba(0, 230, 118, 0.55)">the AI-based model completely fails to reproduce the rapid initial growth rates and hence would incorrectly suggest an unlimited predictability of the atmosphere</span>. In contrast, if the initial perturbations are large and comparable to current uncertainties in the estimation of the initial state, the AI-based model basically agrees with physically-based simulations, although some deficits are still present.
