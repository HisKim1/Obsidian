The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Artificial Intelligence (AI) Strategy will dramatically expand the application of artificial intelligence (AI) in every NOAA mission area by improving the efficiency, effectiveness, and coordination of AI development and usage across the agency. As data exploitation capabilities continue to increase exponentially with improved satellite systems and architecture, unmanned systems and commercial data sources, AI methods will provide transformative advancements in the quality and timeliness of NOAA science, products, and services. The term “AI” is used here to encompass the capabilities identified in the “AI Capabilities” graphic on page 4. The reason for developing this strategy is because AI capabilities are already demonstrating significant improvements in performance and skill at vastly reduced costs and compute time. 

This strategy aligns with the President’s Executive Order on Maintaining American Leadership in Artificial Intelligence1 and the 2019 Update to the National Artificial Intelligence Research and Development Strategic Plan.2 It also supports provisions in the Weather Research and Forecasting Innovation Act of 20173 and its 2019 reauthorization,4 as well as the Commercial Engagement Through Ocean Technology (CENOTE) Act of 2018.5 This strategy also supports the November 19, 2019, presidential memorandum “Memorandum on Ocean Mapping of the United States Exclusive Economic Zone and the Shoreline and Nearshore of Alaska.” Lastly, the NOAA AI Strategy supports the DOC Strategic Plan for 2018-2022,6 and will accelerate NOAA’s top two priorities to (1) regain world leadership in global weather modeling through establishment of the Earth Prediction Innovation Center (EPIC), and (2) sustainably grow the economic contributions of our oceans, coasts, and Great Lakes (American Blue Economy).7
